# Deep Reinforcement Learning Drone

This is my implementation of the https://github.com/guillem74/DRLDBackEnd repo. in order to compare it with my proposed approach. I upgraded the libraries to work with the new airsim api and openai baseline

This repository integrates AirSim with openAI gym and keras-rl for autonomous vehicles through deep reinforcement learning. AirSim allows you to easly create your own environment in Unreal Editor and keras-rl let gives your the RL tools to solve the task.

Requirements:

[AirSim](https://github.com/Microsoft/AirSim)

[keras-rl](https://github.com/matthiasplappert/keras-rl)

[openAI gym](https://github.com/openai/gym)
